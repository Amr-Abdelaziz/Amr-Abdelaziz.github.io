            I am currently working at Microsft as a Sr. Principal Applied Scientist.
            I was staff research scientist and manager at NewsBreak (series C startup).
            I was a senior research scientist at Facebook Seattle & Google Research
            in Zurich, Switzerland with a focus on Computer Vision and Ads ranking.

            I got my MPhil from The Chinese University of Hong Kong supervised
            by Professor Xiaogang Wang. I was also a member of MMlab and
            worked closely with Professor Xiaoou Tang. Before CUHK, I got my
            bachelor from Tsinghua University, where I was a member of the Yao
            Class. I did my bachelor thesis with Professor Changshui Zhang. I
            also work with academia through university relationship. I worked
            closely with ETH CVL led by Professor Luc Van Gool on
            co-organizing Webvision challenge and workshop.
