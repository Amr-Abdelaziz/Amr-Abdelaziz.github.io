          I am currently working at Microsft as a Sr Principal Applied Scientist. I was staff research scientist and manager at NewsBreak (series C startup). I was a senior research scientist at Facebook Seattle working on Video Ads and Marketplace Product Intelligence. Before Facebook, I was a senior software engineer at Google Research in Zurich, Switzerland. My research at Google focused on video analysis and its applications in making YouTube free and enjoyable. I also work with academia through university relationship. I worked closely with ETH CVL led by Professor Luc Van Gool on co-organizing Webvision challenge and workshop.

<br />
I got my MPhil from The Chinese University of Hong Kong supervised by Professor Xiaogang Wang. I was also a member of MMlab and worked closely with Professor Xiaoou Tang. Before CUHK, I got my bachelor from Tsinghua University, where I was a member of the Yao Class. I did my bachelor thesis with Professor Changshui Zhang.

<br />
After my daytime research, I am a contributor to scikit-learn. A Kaggle Master. Reviewer for computer vision journals and conferences. A history lover, an ameteur photographer and a traveler (30+ countries and counting).
